\section{Introduction to Graph Theory}

\subsection{Definition of a graph}
\paragraph{}
A graph is defined as a pair of sets G = (V, E), such that E $\subseteq$ $V^2$. The members of V are called vertices and the ones of E edges. Take into account, that the vertices can be anything, they can even be sets themselves. The usual way to draw a graph is by representing the vertices as individual points and for each edge, draw a link between both elements of that edge. The shape in which a graph is drawn is irrelevant, it will contain the same information.

\subsection{Connectivity}
\paragraph{}
An essential concept in graph theory is adjacency. Two vertices x, y $\in$ V are said to be adjacent in G if and only if \{x, y\} $\in$ E.
