\section{Introduction to Tree Depth}

\subsection{Basic definitions}

\paragraph{}
Vertex x is said to be the ancestor of y in a rooted forest F, if and only if x belongs to the path between y and the root of the component to which x belongs, y included.
\paragraph{}
The closure of a rooted forest F, expressed as C = clos(F), is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item V(C) = V(F)
  \item E(C) = \{\{x, y\} : x is an ancestor of y in F, x $\neq$ y \}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\input{closure-example.tex}
\caption{The blue graph at the left is a rooted forest F, the red graph at the right represents clos(F).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tree Depth}

\begin{definition}
The tree-depth td(G) of a graph G is the minimum height of a rooted forest F such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F)
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
\input{3d-cube-ET.tex}
\caption{The graph G and tree T are in the left and right respectively. The doted edges in T, represent the clos(T). Because G $\subseteq$ clos(T), height(T) = 4 and the definition of tree depth we just gave, we know that td(G) is at most 4.\label{fig:3d-cube}}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
The tree depth of a graph G is a numerical invariant of a graph. In other words, the tree depth is a property that depends only  on the abstract structure of a graph, not in its representation.	

\subsection{Elimination Forest}
\paragraph{}
An elimination forest F of a connected graph G is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If V(G) = \{x\} then F is just \{x\}.
  \item If G is not connected, then F is the union of the elimination forests of each component of G.
  \item Otherwise, r $\in$ V(G) is chosen as the root of F and an elimination forest is created for G $-$ r. The roots of this elimination forest will be the children of r in F.
\end{itemize}
The tree T in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-cube} is an elimination forest for the graph G.

\paragraph{}
The concept of an elimination forest is deeply related to that of tree depth and we will use some lemmas to prove so.

\begin{lemma}
Let G be a graph, $G_i$ a component of G and F an elimination forest such that G $\in$ clos(F). There exists v $\in G_i$ such that for every node in $G_i$ v is its ancestor in F.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will proof this by contradiction. Assume u $\in G_i$ exists
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lema:min-ET}
Let G be a graph and T a rooted forest such that G $\subseteq$ clos(T). Then, Y exists, where Y is an elimination forest of G and height(Y) $\leq$ height(T).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
@TODO
\end{proof}
