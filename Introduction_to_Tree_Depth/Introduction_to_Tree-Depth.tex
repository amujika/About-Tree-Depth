\chapter{Introduction to Tree Depth}

\subsection{Basic definitions}

\paragraph{}
Vertex $x$ is said to be the ancestor of $y$ in a rooted forest $F$, if and only if $x$ belongs to the path between $y$ and the root of the component to which $x$ belongs, $y$ included.

\begin{definition}
The closure of a rooted forest $F$, expressed as $C$ = clos($F$), is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item V(C) = V($F$)
  \item E(C) = \{\{$x$, $y$\} : $x \neq y$ and $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ in $F$\}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{The blue graph at the left is a rooted forest F, the red graph at the right represents clos(F).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tree Depth}

\begin{definition}
The tree-depth td(G) of a graph G is the minimum height of a rooted forest F such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F)
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
\input{3d-cube-ET.tex}
\caption{The graph G and tree T are in the left and right respectively. The doted edges in T, represent the clos(T). Because G $\subseteq$ clos(T), height(T) = 5 and the definition of tree depth we just gave, we know that td(G) is at most~5.\label{fig:3d-cube}}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
The tree depth of a graph G is a numerical invariant of a graph. In other words, the tree depth is a property that depends only  on the abstract structure of a graph, not on its representation.	

\subsection{Elimination Forest}
\paragraph{}
An elimination forest F of a connected graph G = (V, E) is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If V = \{x\} then F is just \{x\}.
  \item If G is not connected, then F is the union of the elimination forests of each component of G.
  \item Otherwise, r $\in$ V is chosen as the root of F and an elimination forest is created for G $-$ r. The roots of this elimination forest will be the children of r in F.
\end{itemize}
The tree T in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-cube} is an elimination forest for the graph G.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lema:min-ET}
Let G be a graph and F a rooted forest such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F). Then, Y exists, where Y is an elimination forest of G and height(Y) $\leq$ height(F).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \item \textbf{Base case}: If V(G) = \{v\}, then V(Y) = \{v\} and height(Y) = 1. Beware that F can have nodes that are not in G but it must contain v, so height(Y) $\leq$ height(F).
  \item \textbf{Induction}: If G is connected, set the root of F, v, as the root of Y. Clearly, G-v $\subseteq$ clos(F-v), so by induction an elimination forest Y' exists such that G-v $\subseteq$ clos(Y') and height(Y') $\leq$ height(F-v). The roots of Y' will be the children of v in Y and as G-v $\subseteq$ clos(Y'), then G $\subseteq$ clos(Y) and Y is an elimination forest. With that we can prove the lemma like this: height(Y) = 1 + height(Y') $\leq$ 1 + height(F-v) = height(F), so height(Y) $\leq$ height(F).
  
  If G is not connected, then every component $G_i$ in G is contained in the closure of a component $F_i$ in F. Otherwise, the edge between two adjacent nodes in G that are both in $G_i$ but in two diferent components of F wouldn't be in clos(F) and that can't happen. By induction we can assume that for every component $G_i$, there exists an elimination forest $Y_i$ such that $G_i \subseteq$ clos($Y_i$) and height($Y_i$) $\leq$ height($F_i$). Y will be the union of all these $Y_i$ which is clearly an elimination forest and because for every component of Y there exists a component in F with higher or equal height, then height(Y) $\leq$ height(F).
\end{proof}

\paragraph{}
From this lemma we can say that the tree depth of a graph is the minimal height of an elimination forest for that graph. We can now recursively define the tree depth of a graph using the definition of an elimination forest:

\begin{definition}
The tree depth of a graph $G$ with $G_1, \ldots, G_k$ components is the following:
\[ td(G) = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    1 & \quad \text{if $\vert G\vert$ = 1}\\
    max^p_{i=1}td(G_i) & \quad \text{if $G$ is not connected}\\
    1 + min_{v \in V(G)}td(G-v) & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.\]
\end{definition}
