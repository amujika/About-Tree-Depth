\section{Introduction to Tree Depth}

\subsection{Basic definitions}

\paragraph{}
Vertex x is said to be the ancestor of y in a rooted forest F, if and only if x belongs to the path between y and the root of the component to which x belongs, y included.
\paragraph{}
The closure of a rooted forest F, expressed as C = clos(F), is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item V(C) = V(F)
  \item E(C) = \{\{x, y\} : x is an ancestor of y in F, x $\neq$ y \}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\input{closure-example.tex}
\caption{The blue graph at the left is a rooted forest F, the red graph at the right represents clos(F).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tree Depth}

\paragraph{Definition:}The tree-depth td(G) of a graph G is the minimum height of a rooted forest F such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F)

\begin{figure}[H]
\input{3d-cube-ET.tex}
\caption{The graph G and tree T are in the left and right respectively. The doted edges in T, represent the clos(T). Because G $\subseteq$ clos(T), we know that td(G) is at most 4.\label{fig:3d-cube}}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{}
The tree depth of a graph G is a numerical invariant of a graph. In other words, the tree depth is a property that depends only  on the abstract structure of a graph, not in its	 representation.	

\subsection{Elimination tree}
\paragraph{}
An elimination tree Y of a connected graph G is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If V(G) = \{x\} then Y is just \{x\}.
  \item Otherwise, r $\in$ V(G) is chosen as the root of Y and an elimination tree is created for each component of G-r. r will be connected to the root of each of these trees.
\end{itemize}
The tree T in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-cube} is an elimination tree for the graph G.
