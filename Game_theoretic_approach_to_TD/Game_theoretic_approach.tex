\section{Game Theoretic approach to Tree-Depth}

\subsection{Defining the game}
\paragraph{}
For k $\geq$ 0, the k-step selection-deletion game is played by Alice and Bob on a graph. The game is played by turns as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First, Alice selects a connected component of the graph, and the rest of the components are deleted.
  \item Then, Bob deletes a node from the remaining graph and the next round is played with this graph.
\end{itemize}

If Bob deletes the last node at the k-th round or earlier, he is said to win. Otherwise, Alice wins.
\paragraph{}
From this definition we can observe that if Bob has a strategy to win in k rounds that strategy will also guaranty a win in any game that lasts more than k rounds. Conversely, if Alice has a winning strategy in k-rounds, that same strategy will also win any game with less than k rounds.

\subsection{Bob's winning strategy}
\begin{lemma}
Let G be a graph and let F be a rooted forest of height t such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F). Then, Bob has a winning strategy for the t-step selection-deletion game.
\label{lemma:Bob-win}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Because of lemma~\ref{lema:min-ET} we know an elimination forest Y exists such that height(Y) $\leq$ height(F).
Consider h = height(Y), we will prove that a winning strategy exists in h rounds which is also a winning strategy in the t-step selection-deletion game because h $\leq$ t.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Base case}: If h = 1, then every component of G will have a single vertex, so it's clear that Bob will win the 1-step selection-deletion game.
  \item \textbf{Induction}: Let $G_i \subseteq G$ be the component Alice chooses, then $Y_i$ exists such that $Y_i$ is an elimination forest belonging to Y, $G_i \subseteq clos(Y_i)$ and obviously height($Y_i$) $\leq$ h. Bob will delete v, the root of $Y_i$. This will leave us with $G' = G_i - v$ as the new graph. If we consider the children of v the new roots in $Y' = Y_i - v$, then $G' \subseteq clos(Y')$ because of how the elimination forests are built. As $height(Y') \leq$ h-1, we can assume by induction that Bob has a winning strategy in h-1 rounds for $G'$, which together with the strategy for the first round we have just defined makes a winning strategy for Bob in the h-step selection-deletion game on the graph G.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Alice's winning strategy}
\begin{definition}
A shelter $S$ in a graph $G$ is a set of graphs with the next properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\forall H \in S$, $H \subseteq G$ and $H$ is connected.
  \item $H$ is said to be minimal if no $H'$ exists in $S$ such that $H' \subset H$.
  \item $H$ is said to be maximal if no $H'$ exists in $S$ such that $H \subset H'$.
  \item If $H \in S$ and $H$ is not minimal, then $\forall v \in V(H)$, there exists $H' \subseteq H - v$ such that $H$ covers $H'$. We will say that $a \in S$ covers $b \in S$ if and only if $b \subset a$, and no $c \in S$ exists such that $b \subset c \subset a$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
\input{shelter-example.tex}
\caption{An example of a shelter. The arrows represent the covering relation. \label{fig:shelter-example}}
\end{figure}
The thickness of a shelter S is the shortest sequence of elements in S of the form $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ such that $a_1$ is maximal and $a_n$ is minimal and if $2 \leq i \leq n$, then $a_{i-1}$ covers $a_i$. The length of a chain is defined as the number of elements in it. The thickness of the shelter in figure~\ref{fig:shelter-example} is 2, because of the sequence $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}, \{4\}$.
\begin{lemma}
Let G be a graph, S a shelter in G, and t the thickness of S. Then, there exists a winning strategy for Alice in the (t-1)-step selection-deletion game.
\label{lemma:Alice-win}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will proof this by induction over t.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Base case}: If t = 1, then clearly Alice wins the 0-step selection-deletion game.
  \item \textbf{Induction}: Let H be a maximal element in S. Then, Alice picks the connected component $G_i$ of $G$, such that $H \subseteq G_i$. Because t $>$ 0, $H$ is not minimal, so for any vertex $v$ that Bob removes, if $v \in H$ there exists $H' \in S$ that is covered by $H$ and $v \notin H'$. Otherwise, $H$ is still a subgraph of $G_i - v$. Let $S' =\left\{X \mid X \in S \, \wedge \, X \subseteq G_i - v\right\}$. It is clear that $S'$ is a shelter for $G_i - v$ and that the thickness of $S'$ is greater than or equal to t-1. By induction we can assume Alice has a winning strategy in t-2 steps in $G_i - v$, which together with the strategy for the first round we have just defined is a winning strategy for the (t-1)-step selection-deletion game.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Relation to Tree-Depth}

\paragraph{}
It is clear that if Alice has a winning strategy in the t-step selection deletion game, Bob can't have a winning strategy in that same game. Because of this and lemmas~\ref{lemma:Bob-win} and ~\ref{lemma:Alice-win} we can state the following:
\begin{theorem}
Let G be a graph, S a shelter in G of thickness x and F a rooted forest of height y such that G $\subseteq$ clos(F). Then the following is true.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Alice has a winning strategy in the (t-1)-step selection-deletion game, for any t smaller than or equal to x.
\item Bob has a winning strategy in the t-step selection-deletion game, for any t greater than or equal to y.
\item Every rooted forest who's closure contains G has an height higher than or equal to x. Otherwise, Bob would have a winning strategy in the (x-1)-step selection-deletion game, which contradicts statement 1.
\item Every shelter in G has a thickness smaller than or equal to y. Otherwise, Alice would have a winning strategy in the y-step selection-deletion game, which contradicts statement 2.
\item Because we have F, $td(G) \leq y$. Also, from statement 3 it is clear that $x \leq td(G)$. So we can say that $x \leq td(G) \leq y$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{}
With this theorem we can now give an upper-bound and a lower-bound to a graphs tree depth.

\caption{This is a shelter of thickness 5 for the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-cube}. Beware that not all graphs in the shelter are drawn, but every graph in the shelter is isomorphic to these. With this and the rooted forest from Figure~\ref{fig:3d-cube} we can say that td(G) = 5.
